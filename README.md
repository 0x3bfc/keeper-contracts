[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/oceanprotocol/plankton-keeper.svg?token=soMi2nNfCZq19zS1Rx4i&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/oceanprotocol/plankton-keeper)

Ocean Keeper implementation where we put the following modules together:

* **TCRs**: users create challenges and resolve them through voting to maintain registries;
* **Ocean Tokens**: the intrinsic tokens circulated inside Ocean network, which is used in the voting of TCRs;
* **Curated Proofs Market**: the core marketplace where people can transact with each other and curate assets through staking with Ocean tokens.


## Usage

Use `$ npm install` to download all the required libraries

Use `$ truffle compile` to compile those solidity files:

Then deploy them into testRPC `$ truffle migrate`:

Note:

* there are `Error: run out of gas` because we try to deploy so many contracts as one single transaction. Tune the `gas` value in `truffle.js` file to make them run through.
* we enable the solc optimizer to reduce the gas cost of deployment. It can now be deployed with less gas limit such as "gas = 5000000"
* no need to update the "from : 0x3424ft..." in `truffle.js` and it will use the first account in testRPC or ganache-cli by default.

Test them with `$ truffle test test/registry.js`:

## Public Interfaces

The following project exposes the following public interfaces:

### Curation Market

```solidity
//Allows a user to start an application. Takes tokens from user and sets apply stage end time.
function apply(bytes32 _listingHash, uint _amount, string _data);

// Allows the owner of a listingHash to increase their unstaked deposit.
function deposit(bytes32 _listingHash, uint _amount);

## Get Started

As a pre-requisite, you need Node.js >= v6.11.5.

Clone the project and install all dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/plankton-keeper.git
cd plankton-keeper/

# install dependencies
npm i

# install RPC client globally
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

### Marketplace

Compile the solidity contracts:

```bash
truffle compile
```

### Query functions

```solidity

// Return the number of drops associated to the message.sender to an Asset 
function dropsBalance(uint256 assetId) public view returns (uint256);

// Return true or false if an Asset is active given the assetId
function checkAsset(uint256 assetId) public view returns (bool);

// Get the url attribute associated to a given the assetId
function getAssetUrl(uint256 assetId) public view returns (bytes32);

In a new terminal, launch an Ethereum RPC client, e.g. [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli):

```bash
ganache-cli
```

Switch back to your other terminal and deploy the contracts:

```bash
truffle migrate

# for redeployment run this instead
truffle migrate --reset
```

Note:
* there are `Error: run out of gas` because we try to deploy so many contracts as one single transaction. Tune the `gas` value in `truffle.js` file to make them run through.
* we enable the solc optimizer to reduce the gas cost of deployment. It can now be deployed with less gas limit such as `gas = 5000000`
* no need to update the `from : 0x3424ft...` in `truffle.js` and it will use the first account in testRPC or ganache-cli by default.

## Testing

Run tests with `truffle test`, e.g.:

```bash
truffle test test/registry.js
```
